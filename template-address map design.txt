Bus = Interconnect


Following objects take part in determining the address map:
- processor interfaces
- bus
- interface adapters/translators
- address space decoders
- end devices


The structure of the interface and the electrical and logical organization of its signaling is determined by one or more levels of protocol.

Bus share the characteristics of the interfaces they connect.


Each interface has the following attributes:
- address width
- address granularity (byte-shift=0, word-shift=1, dword-shift=2, qword-shift=3)
- data bus width
- clock frequency
- endianess (byte and bit)
- virtual vs. physical addressing
- protocol
-- multiplexed or separate address/data busses
-- stream vs. transaction oriented
-- flow control via in-band (IB) or out-of-band (OOB) signaling
-- cachability and cache-coherence


Interfaces can have one or more real or virtual channels.

Transactions have the following attributes:
- synchronous vs. asynchronous
- packet vs. circuit oriented


Address map features:
- Each interface sees an address space
- The size of the address space in terms of addressable objects is determined by the address width and granularity.
- The parent address space can be divided into child address spaces (regions) by the decoders
- Regions can be fully or partially decoded
- Fully decoded regions occupy a single space in their parent address space
- Partially decoded regions are aliased several times in their parent address space
- An end device is mapped in a region


Address map is to be documented in the following way:
- Starting from processor (upstream) and going down to the final device (downstream)
- for each interface
-- Total size of the address space seen by the interface
-- Granularity of addressing (AG)
-- Granularity of accessed objects (OG) (can be different from AG if there are byte-enable signals)
-- Clock frequency
-- Data width
-- Endiannes
-- Protocol
-- List of interface converters. For each downstream interface perform the same description.
-- List of decoded regions (by decoders or end devices). For each region:
--- decoded parent address bits (mask and value)
--- offset in parent space
--- size
--- final absolute address as seen by the programmer
